💫 About Me:
       I’m a passionate software engineer with a B.Tech in Computer Science, specializing in full-stack development. I enjoy building efficient and scalable web applications using technologies like C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, and SQL.

I’m focused on creating robust backend APIs with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I’m always excited to learn and apply new technologies. When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest trends in AI and cloud computing.
